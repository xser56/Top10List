                    The Artificer class is my number one favorite class because of how versatile it can be. The class's main features revolve around infusing magical properties into objects via Infuse Item. Through this you can temporarily make a number of magic items to either use yourself or share with your party. At higher levels, Artificers are able to use more magic items than any other class, increasing their versatility. Its subclasses reflect this class's infusion feature by imbuing magical properties into a kind of object: Alchemist creates elixirs that grant magical boons, the Artillerist creates a magical cannon, Armorer imbues their armor with unique magical properties, and Battle Smith creates loyal sentient constructs. The Artificer can be almost anything the party needs.

                    The Paladin is probably the most ideal class for those who want to tank hits. Its Divine Smite allows for extra damage with their attacks at the expense of a spell slot. Later features grant auras which grants benefits to both the Paladin and the party, as well as suffusing your attacks with more damage. The subclasses don't let it branch out too much in terms of versatility, instead opting to do things slightly differently with what the Paladin already does. Oath of Devotion helps against enemy charms, Oath of the Ancients helps to last longer in a fight, and Oath of Vengeance makes it deadlier in a fight. The Oathbreaker stands out as a sort of antithesis to the Paladin as it channels dark powers to dominate the battle. The class's biggest disadvantage would be its lack of reliable ranged attacks.

                    To the informed, the Cleric is among the most versatile classes out there. With Cantrips to both attack and assist, powerful damaging spells right out the gate, and subclass features that let it suit almost ANY role, this class is one of the best in the game. The Knowledge Domain grants extra skill proficiencies, the Life Domain makes your healing BETTER, the Light Domain gives you better damage options, the Nature Domain partially turns you into a Druid, the Tempest Domain provides great crowd-control abilities, the Trickery Domain applies great Illusion spells, and the War Domain bolsters the Cleric's otherwise lackluster weapon combat options. If you wanted, you could make an entire party of Clerics and wreak havoc. The downside is: they are more reliant on their spells than most classes.

                    The Fighter may seem boring to most, but that's because it shines brightest in its one area of expertise: combat. Few things are as dangerous in a fight as an enemy that can attack several times in a turn. Features like Second Wind and Indomitable make the class harder to take down, and additional fighting styles make them that much more dangerous. The Battlemaster subclass adds extra effects to their attacks, the Champion makes it easier to score critical hits, and Eldritch Knight grants new magical options to spice up combat. This class dominates over others in a fight, but that's all it's good for. Outside of combat, it lacks any features to make it useful in any other situation.

                    The Warlock is probably the most unique spellcaster in the game. Unlike others, the Warlock can only cast spells a few times per day. This class has to manage its limited resources well to be very effective. It is strongly supported by its class and subclass features, along with its unique ability to regain spells slots on a short rest. The Archfey subclass helps with charms and illusions, the Fiend supplies excellent offensive and defensive options, and the Great Old One gives a mixed bag of mostly useful features. The downside is that this is a difficult class to master, and is often used as a secondary class to others like Sorcerer or Paladin.

                    Probably the most memeable class in the game, the Bard is the regular Jack-of-all-trades class, shining most brightly in conversations with high persuasion and deception skills. This spellcasting class has a heavy focus on supporting their allies and/or de-buffing their enemies. Its signature feature, Bardic Inspiration, gives a bonus to an ally's failed attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, possibly turning a failure into a success. The subclass College of Eloquence takes the class's standard features and dials them up to 11, making their Bardic Inspiration more useful. The College of Lore grants two new uses for their Bardic Inspiration, as well as extra wizard spells. The College of Valor makes them more martial than magical. Their drawback, however, is their lack of offensive options available to them.

                    The quintessential musclehead, the Barbarian is a Fighter that learned to weaponize its anger. With the highest hit point average and its signature Rage, the Barbarian is meant to rush headlong into combat and tank almost anything that's thrown at it. The most basic of its subclasses, the Path of the Berserker emphasizes the near-blind fury of the Berserkirs of old. The Path of the Totem Warrior grants a variety of features of your choosing. The Path of Wild Magic boosts the Barbarian and/or their allies with a random beneficial effect upon raging. The caveat to this class is that it requires one to keep attacking or getting attacked to maintain a rage and is less useful out of combat than the Fighter.

                    The Wizard, shockingly, specializes in the art of spellcasting more than any other class. It also can learn the most spells of any other classes. Because of this, their spells range from offensive to defensive to buffs to de-buffs to convenient to situational. Their subclasses, called Schools, are just as varied. Abjuration makes the Wizard more durable. Conjuration makes them better with summons and teleportation. Divination grants them and their allies some limited foresight. Enchantment provides buffs and charms. Evocation improves their damaging spells. Illusion creates better illusions. Necromancy lets one tamper with life energy and make undead. Transmutation advances their ability to alter the form of people and objects. With all that said, if they lose their spellcasting, they're incredibly vulnerable.

                    The Druid focuses more on the magic in nature over anything else. Its signature feature Wild Shape lets them change into a list of animals, that list growing at higher levels. This class's spell list focuses more on healing and natural support. Its subclasses, called Circles, support this theme in various ways. Circle of the Land grants additional spells as well as additional benefits while in nature. Circle of the Moon puts more emphasis on the Druid's Wild Shape feature, expanding and improving on it. Circle of Spores lets the Druid use their Wild Shape to instead grant themselves temporary bonuses, deal more damage, and create undead. The unfortunate thing is that the spell list leaves something to be desired, and their aversion to metal armor and weapons limits them in case they can't use their Wild Shape.

                    The Rogue class puts a heavy emphasis on their ability to sneak up on their target, as shown with their main feature to deal extra damage with their Sneak Attack. The class provides extra and improved skill proficiencies, even making themselves harder to hit with spells thanks to their Evasion feature. The subclass Arcane Trickster grants the Rogue limited spellcasting. The Assassin subclass is a weird mixture or increasing damage output and disguising oneself. The Thief subclass is an even weirder mixture of features, such as an increased Climbing speed, advantage on Stealth checks, and an extra turn during the first round of combat. However, their lack of weapon and armor proficiencies forces them into a repetitive combat pattern with little variation.
