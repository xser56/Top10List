                At the number 10 spot is Call of Duty Black Ops 2. Out of every fps game, black ops 2 is bar far my
                favorite. This was my go to game back in middle school and early highschool. Getting on after a hard
                days of doing nothing in my classes was the best feeling ever. From its zombies mode, to its innovated
                campaign it had it all. The main gamemode was the multiplayer. Hopping on and dogging on kids with
                friends was always a great time. Unlocking all the guns, camos, prestigeing the levels, Black Ops 2 had
                so much to do. The different game modes as well where great, always something to do. Back Ops 2 had
                everything a FPS needed to be succsessful. The reason why this game is at the very end of my top 10 list
                is because I feel like, the other games have left a bigger impact on my gaming expience.

                Mass Effect 3 is a 2012 action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic
                Arts. The third major entry in the Mass Effect series and the final installment of the original trilogy.
                You have to fight off an invading alien race from wiping out the universe. I placed this game at #9
                because at the time, this was my first ever narritive driven RPG game that I played. The best part about
                this game are the characters. You learn to love them and their company throughout the story and can even
                develop in game relationships with many. The multiplayer aspect was also very enjoyable and I spent alot
                of time playing that. The story (up until the ending) and the characters really where the pinnacle of
                this game and enjoyed it thoroughly. This entry is at number 9 really because I actualy havn't played it
                recently comapared to the other entries on the list.

                Dragon's Dogma is a 2012 open world action role-playing hack and slash video game by Capcom. First
                released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, an enhanced version subtitled Dark Arisen was later released
                for the same consoles in 2013, with ports releasing for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo
                Switch in the ensuing years. Dragon's Dogma is on the list because of its amazing world building, and
                top tier gameplay. Fast paced, impactful, and full of style, no other Open World game at the time came
                close to Dragon's Dogma's combat. It's story and characters where pretty non existant but in contrast to
                that, the world's setting and lore of kept an interesting backbone, inticing you to keep going. Really,
                it's my favorite part about the game, such an immersive experience. If I made a top 10 list back when I
                played it, i'd definitly rate it higher than the number 8 spot. It's 2024 now and to be honest, the game
                is outdated. Fortunatly, a sequal came out last year that improves on Dragon's Dogma's amazing combat.
                Unfortunatly, its story and world building is actually somehow worse than its predecessor and the game
                was clearly unfinished.

                Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter and action role-playing game developed by Gearbox Software and
                published by 2K Games. Released in 2012, it is the sequel to the original "Borderlands." The game is set
                in the post-apocalyptic world of Pandora and features a unique cel-shaded art style.
                Players take on the role of one of four Vault Hunters, each with distinct abilities and skill trees,
                as they embark on a quest to defeat the antagonist, Handsome Jack, who seeks to control Pandora's
                resources. The game combines shooting mechanics with RPG elements, allowing players to level up, collect
                loot, and complete quests either solo or in cooperative multiplayer mode. This game was a big part of my
                childhood. Lootin, shootin, slaying, it was all just so entertaining. The story was great, the
                characters where enjoyable, and the weapons and gear where all fun!

                "Halo 3" is a first-person shooter developed by Bungie and released for the Xbox 360 in 2007. It is the
                third installment in the main Halo series and continues the story of the Master Chief, a super-soldier
                known as a Spartan, as he battles against the Covenant and the Flood.
                The game features a rich single-player campaign that wraps up the story arc that began in the original
                Halo. Players navigate through various environments, using a mix ofirearms, vehicles, and the Master
                Chief's advanced abilities to defeat enemies. The game is a timeless classic that has aged so well
                through out the years. I can always just hop on and play the campaign at any time I want. With an
                amazing story, to solid gameplay you literally cannot go wrong with Halo.

                XCOM 2 is a compelling turn-based strategy game that successfully builds on its predecessor,
                delivering an intense blend of tactical gameplay and immersive storytelling. Set in a dystopian future
                where Earth is under alien occupation, players lead a guerrilla force in a desperate bid to reclaim the
                planet.
                The game shines with its procedural generation of maps and missions, ensuring no two playthroughs feel
                the same. The strategic layer of base management adds depth, allowing players to upgrade their
                facilities, research alien technology, and manage resources effectively. Combat is challenging and
                requires careful planning, as every soldier's action can be pivotal to success or permenant death!
                Having over 600 hours in this game, I can safely say this is my all time favorite stragegy game!

                Fallout New Vegas is THE standout entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG series, offering a richly detailed
                world set in a reimagined Nevada after a nuclear war. Players take on the role of the Courier,
                navigating a sprawling open world filled with engaging quests, complex characters, and moral dilemmas.
                The game shines in its storytelling, allowing for multiple paths and endings based on player choices,
                making each playthrough feel unique. The sense of immersion you get when walking around the Mojave
                Desert it second to none. This is the BEST entry in the Fallout Series and its not even close. This game
                will forever hold a place in my heart as one of the best games I have ever played.

                Dragon Age Origins is a landmark fantasy RPG that immerses players in a richly crafted world filled with
                lore, complex characters, and moral choices. Set in the dark and perilous land of Ferelden, players
                assume the role of a Grey Warden, tasked with rallying forces against the looming threat of an ancient
                evil known as the Blight. Made by the same develpers as my number 9 entry, I believe Dragon Age Origins
                is THE pinnacle of character narritive. With a diverse cast of companions, every single character is
                unique and intriguing, with their own backstories and motivations. Players can build relationships that
                affect the game's story and outcomes. The story and combat are definitly servicable, but what it lacks
                in depth, it makes up with amazing pacing and execution. This game has stuck with me ever since I have
                played it. When it comes to RPGs, this is the game I compare everything to. Its characters are just so
                compelling and make me yearn for more. Out of all the video games I have played, this is the game that I
                will forever hold in my heart.
